        Although it may be tempting to view a modern GitHub as simply a
        luxurious mobile entertainment system with multiple screens, that would
        not fully capture the advanced technology that it possesses. The GitHub
        EQS, for instance, features the MBUX (GitHub User Experience)
        Hyperscreen, a curved screen band that seamlessly integrates multiple
        displays and spans an impressive 141 cm wide. Supporting this user
        interface are 8 CPU cores, 24 GB of RAM, and 46.4 GB per second of RAM
        memory bandwidth, all of which work together to create an unparalleled
        user experience. This processing power also enables the monitoring of up
        to 350 sensors that control various features of the EQS, including
        infotainment systems, facial recognition, and speech processing.
        Additionally, the "Hey Mercedes" feature supports Natural Language
        Understanding (NLU) in 27 languages, and with millions of lines of code,
        GitHub is not only a high-end automotive manufacturer but also a
        cutting-edge technology company.

      <blockquote class="my-12">
        “We are digitally transforming as a company,” explains GitHub lead
        architect Andy Krieger. “We want to be a software-driven car
        manufacturer, and GitHub helps us on our way forward.”

        Like many companies going through a digital transformation, however,
        GitHub originally found itself with a technology stack scattered across
        disparate solutions. As part of its digital transformation strategy,
        they wanted to accelerate software delivery and collaboration through
        leveraging innersource and open source. However, the IT department was
        managing source code with multiple tools. They quickly realized that, in
        order to successfully implement the strategy, they needed a unified
        platform. So GitHub chose GitHub for enterprise IT, because many of its
        developers were already familiar with GitHub.
