<p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-500 mt-6">
                Semplice Analytics now supports measuring Interaction to Next
                Paint (INP).
              </p>
              <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-500 mt-6">
                INP measures your site’s responsiveness to user interactions on
                the page. The faster your page responds to user input – the
                better. INP is an experimental metric to develop a better way of
                measuring responsiveness than First Input Delay (FID).
