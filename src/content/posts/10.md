Street photography is a mix of instinct, observation, and guts. You're working with what’s given — real people, real moments, no control — and that’s what makes it thrilling.

## 1. Blend Into the Environment

Wear neutral clothes, move slowly, and act like you belong. The less attention you draw, the more natural your subjects will appear.

## 2. Shoot with Purpose

Know what you're looking for: emotion, symmetry, odd juxtapositions, quiet stories. A clear intention helps you notice things faster.

## 3. Get Closer Than You Think

The best moments often happen right in front of you. Don’t be afraid to step in (respectfully). The more present you are, the more powerful your images will be.

## 4. Use the Light You Have

Harsh shadows, neon signs, soft reflections — street light
