<p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-6">
  Semplice Analytics now supports measuring Interaction to Next
  Paint (INP).
</p>
<p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-500 mt-6">
  INP measures your site’s responsiveness to user interactions on
  the page. The faster your page responds to user input – the
  better. INP is an experimental metric to develop a better way of
  measuring responsiveness than First Input Delay (FID).

<ul>
  <li>Each category will have associated thresholds and dollar values. You are now able to select multiple thresholds and be notified only when they are reached.</li>
  <li>You can choose not to receive usage notifications for one of the categories. However, we do not recommend this action because you will be aware when you are approaching additional charges and will not be surprised by a large overage invoice.</li>
</ul>
