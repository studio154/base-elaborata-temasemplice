Portrait photography isn’t just about aperture and lighting — it’s about trust. To capture something meaningful, you need more than a sharp lens. You need a human connection.

## 1. Build a Real Rapport

Talk. Joke. Ask questions. Let your subject get used to you before the camera even comes out. The more relaxed they feel, the more natural your photos will be.

## 2. Give Simple Direction

Most people aren’t models. Give light, encouraging direction rather than overwhelming instructions. Focus on mood and emotion rather than exact poses.

## 3. Focus on the Eyes

The eyes tell the story. Whether it’s joy, tension, vulnerability, or confidence — make sure your composition draws the viewer into them.

## 4. Use Natural Light When You Can

Window light is magic. So is golden hour. Natural light tends to make people feel more at ease, and it often flatters skin tones beautifully.

## 5. Capture the In-Between Moments

The real gold is often in the seconds before or after a pose. Keep shooting when they adjust their hair, exhale, or laugh at something.

Portraits are a collaboration — not just a picture _of_ someone, but a moment _with_ them. When your subject feels safe and seen, the camera disappears. That’s when the good stuff happens.
