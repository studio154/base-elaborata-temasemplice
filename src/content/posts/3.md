Composition is the backbone of any great photograph. It's the invisible structure that directs the viewer’s eye, sets the tone, and gives the image weight. Whether you're just starting out or refining your style, learning to compose intentionally can elevate every frame you take.

## 1. Use Symmetry and Asymmetry

Symmetrical compositions offer calm and order. Asymmetrical ones add tension and dynamism. Both are powerful when used with purpose.

## 2. Balance the Elements

Think of visual weight. A small bright subject on one side might balance a large shadowed area on the other. Every part of the frame matters.

## 3. Mind the Edges

What you leave out is just as important as what you include. Watch the edges of your frame for distractions or unnecessary elements that could break the visual flow.

## 4. Create Depth

Foreground, middle ground, background — layering these intentionally can create a sense of depth and three-dimensionality even in a flat image.

## 5. Let Space Breathe

Don’t overcrowd your subjects. Use negative space to let your subject stand out and breathe within the frame. Sometimes less is more.

Good composition is about intentionality. It’s not about rigid rules, but about making conscious choices. Over time, these choices become instinct.

Keep shooting. Keep adjusting. And most importantly, keep seeing.
