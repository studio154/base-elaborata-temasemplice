<p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-500 mt-6">
              Domains already in use can now be transferred directly to a new
              project on Semplice.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base leading-relaxed text-slate-500 mt-6">
              Previously, domains had to be removed from a project before being
              added to a new one. With this update, if you attempt to move a
              live domain to a new project, a prompt will appear offering to
              move the in-use domain and all associated redirects to the
              selected project.
            </p>
